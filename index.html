                <article class="section_introduction">The <code class="code_inline">4xx</code> class of status code is intended for cases in which the client seems to have erred. Except when responding to a <code class="code_inline">HEAD</code> request, the server should include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are applicable to any request method. User agents should display any included entity to the user. If the client is sending data, a server implementation using TCP should be careful to ensure that the client acknowledges receipt of the packet&lpar;s&rpar; containing the response, before the server closes the input connection. If the client continues sending data to the server after the close, the server's TCP stack will send a reset packet to the client, which may erase the client's unacknowledged input buffers before they can be read and interpreted by the HTTP application.</article>
